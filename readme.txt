Customize your login and password retrieval screens - and still use your 
theme style sheet. Supports non-coders up to advanced coders.

== Description ==
Provides easy access to change your login screen layout and logo. This plugin does not 
disguise your login URI but does allow you to remove all wordpress styling and replace with 
your own - or the current theme styling.

There are several simple options for the non-tech person, or for those with the know-how 
you can directly edit the css for this page. 

This plugin was created because login page is also the failed login page and the 
password retrieval page, and we could not find a plugin that supported all three.

= Features =
* Live preview to observe result
* Can be switched on and off easily
* For the non-coders:
     * Override the site name on the login page without the need for code
     * Replace the wordpress logo without the need for code
     * Specify your login page background image and/or colour without the need for code
     * Reference existing css files
* For the coders:
     * Override css directly on login page
     * Existing login css displayed for easy reference
